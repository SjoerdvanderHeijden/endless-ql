## Features
This application is an interpreter for QL and QLS. 

###QL functionality:

- Parsing a form with if/if-else statements, questions and expression question
- supported data types: integer, string, date, boolean
- boolean questions are shown as checkboxes, other questions are shown as inputs.
- includes evaluation of expressions, supported:

| | Number | Boolean | String | Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Number | + - / * | Error | Error | Error |
| Boolean | Error | &#124;&#124; &amp;&amp; | Error | Error |
| String | Error | Error | + | Error |
| Date | + - | Error | Error | Error |

- outputs the submitted form as a json file

###QLS functionality:
- Parsing a stylesheet with pages, sections, and sections in sections
- Adding default styling to question from the definition in the closest scope (page or section)
- Adding CSS styling to questions / widgets
- overriding widget types for questions

## Development

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Insert QL code into the left of the application, press parse to make a form. Fill the form and press submit to see the results.

Example input can be found in src/parser/textQuestionnaires.txt and src/app/ql-mock-input.ts

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng test --code-coverage` to execute unit tests and get a coverage report
(which can be found in coverage/index.html)

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Generating a new parser
Run `npm run genParserQl` to generate a new QL parser (for example if the grammar has changed)
Run `npm run genParserQls` to generate a new QLS parser (for example if the grammar has changed)

## Before committing
Run `npm run check` before committing to make sure the code is correct. It wil automatically generate a new parser, run linting and tests.
