##### Techniques:
* Java Spring Boot
* Maven
* Antlr


##### Dev
* Run ```./prepare_dev.sh``` to generate the parser java source files and copy
them to the correct location in the source directory. Saves trouble with imports in your IDE ;)


##### Run

```
mvn package
java -jar target/qdsl-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

##### Good to know
* example.txt in root contains form that gets parsed correctly
