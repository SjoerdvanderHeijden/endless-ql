## Doubts

* Can we have escape charachters in string \"?
* Are comments Allowed (And which comments?)?
* Are new lines required by the syntax?
* Double and single string support?

* What's the date format?
* What's the money format?
* Or just call everything Literal (as JS does)?
* support multiple minusses --3 (python does)?

* (FIXED) minus numbers
* (FIXED) unary !

* TODO improve naming
